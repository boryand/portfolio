        <p className="p11">
          Itâ€™s hard to beat a person who never gives up, right? <br /> <br /> My
          name is Boryana Dimirova and I come originally from Bulgaria , but I
          live in Germany since 2018. That year I felt in love in coding and
          since then I'm still climbing the ladder of the Web Development.{" "}
          <br /> <br />I bought a basic HTML/CSS course and few months later I
          wasn't able to do much. Then I said to myself "Coding is hard ", "I
          will never going to make it , it is too hard", but after all does it
          makes sense to give up on your dream , just because you failed the
          first try ? Shortly after that I started working and my job position
          had nothing in common with the career path, that I actually wanted.
          This motivated me enough to actually pursue my dream and promise
          myself to never give up and compromise about my profession. <br />{" "}
          <br />I was so excited to discover WBS Coding School , I saw their
          program and history and I assumed this is the perfect opportunity for
          me. After I started studying , I felt in love with coding even more.

        <h3 className="info1"> My Goals: </h3>
        <p className="p33">
          My goals are to grow in a company and learn new things every day. I
          really see my future in knowing more JS frameworks and being able to
          run more complicated applications. I know that I'm not the most
          experienced developer, but I enjoy researching, learning, and
          gathering information so I think that really makes me a great addition
          to the IT job market.
